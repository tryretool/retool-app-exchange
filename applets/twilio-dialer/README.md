# Twilio Dialer

## Overview
This applet demonstrates how to embed a Twilio dialer in a Retool app. The app is set up with a hardcoded table of "leads" to simulate a simple call center app. You can edit the contents of the leads table directly, or simply type your phone number in the field to try calling yourself.

This serves as an example of how to use Retool [custom components](https://docs.retool.com/docs/custom-components) to add advanced functionality to your apps. You'd need to extensively modify the parts outside of the custom component to use it for anything real!

If you'd just like a guided tour of how the applet works, check out our video walkthrough. Otherwise, read on to learn how to set it up in your own environment!

## Who is this for?
This applet will be most interesting for developers who are familiar with the core concepts of building Retool apps and are looking to take the next step with custom components.

If you're just getting started with Retool, check out [Retool University](https://docs.retool.com/docs/retool-university)!

## Setting up the app
To make outbound calls from your Retool app, you'll first need to get up and running with Twilio:

[Twilio Setup](./docs/twilio-setup.md)

Once you've gotten Twilio set up, follow these steps to get it all working in Retool:
