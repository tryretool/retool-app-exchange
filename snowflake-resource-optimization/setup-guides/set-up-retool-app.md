# Snowflake Resource Optimization Setup - Step 3: Apps in Retool

## What's an App in Retool?
As the name suggests, an App is a single "view" (or "page") that you can build in Retool. An App is built from a combination of Components to construct the UI, and Queries that define calls to your Resources. Queries can do reads or writes.

## Output
The goal of this section is:
* To get Snowflake Resource Optimization: Setup & Configuration into your Retool instance. ðŸš€


## Step 3.1 - Download the app "code"
In this step, you will obtain the code file in the `/code` directory in this Github repo.

To do this, clone this Github repo:
`git clone https://github.com/tryretool/snowflake-resource-optimization.git`

(Alternatively, you can manually click-to-download the file in the [`code/`](./code) directory.)

You will have the following file:

```
- Snowflake-Resource-Optimization-Setup-Configuration.json
```

## Step 3.2 - Import the app "code"
First, let's create a folder to put all of this code into, to keep things organized.
1. On your Retool home page, click "Create new" â†’ "Create a new folder". Give this folder a name you like, e.g. "Snowflake Resource Optimization".

Now, let's import the app.
    * Click "Create new" â†’ "Import an app".
    * Upload the `Snowflake-Resource-Optimization-Setup-Configuration.json` file, and select the folder you just created ("Snowflake Resource Optimization") as the destination.

## Step 3.3 - Test it out
In this section, we're going to test out the functionality in your new app. Ideally, put yourself oncall for whichever service you want to send a test "incident" to in PagerDuty, so that you don't surprise someone else! (Or else, give the person who's oncall a heads-up that you are testing.)

Navigate to your "Incident-Central" folder, and click on the "Report-Incident" app. Choose a service to create a "test" incident for, and fill out the form. This should:
- Page the person who is oncall via PagerDuty.
- Create a Slack channel and add you and the oncall person to it.

Now, click on the "Home" menu item in the navbar to open the Incident Central "Home" page. You should see the new incident listed.

Now, click on "View details" for this incident. You should see the details view load for this incident.

## Summary

You should now have Snowflake Resource Optimization: Setup & Configuration within your Retool instance! ðŸ¥³
