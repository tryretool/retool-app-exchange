# App Setup - Step 1: Snowflake

## What's Snowflake?
Snowflake provides cloud-based data storage and analytics services, and if you're here, you're likely already using it! The Snowflake Resource Optimization: Setup & Configuration app is designed to help you manage your Snowflake resources.

## Output
The goal of this section is to:
* Ensure you have a Snowflake user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role

## Step 1.1 - Snowflake user
The Snowflake Resource Optimization: Setup & Configuration app requires a Snowflake user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role. 

If you would like to create a new Snowflake user for Retool, please follow Snowflake's instructions on [creating a user](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-user-management.html#creating-users). Again, please ensure that this user has the [ACCOUNTADMIN](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-considerations.html#using-the-accountadmin-role) role.

## Summary
You now have a Snowflake user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role, which you can plug into the next step.
